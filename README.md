# LSH_Recommendation_System

Behavioral user data is a valuable resource for understanding audience patterns on Netflix, particularly in the context of UK movies. It offers insights into how viewers interact with the popular streaming platform, allowing researchers and data enthusiasts to explore trends, preferences, and patterns in user engagement with Netflix content. Whether you're interested in analyzing viewing habits, content popularity, or user demographics, this information provides a rich source to gain a deeper understanding of Netflix audience behavior in the United Kingdom.

Now, you and your team have been hired by Netflix to get to know their users. In other words, you will implement hashing and clustering techniques to extract relevant information and highlights from those users and their behavior inside the platform.

Then, let's get started!

## 1. Recommendation system 
Implementing a recommendation system is critical for businesses and digital platforms that want to thrive in today's competitive environment. These systems use data-driven personalization to tailor content, products, and services to individual user preferences. The latter improves user engagement, satisfaction, retention, and revenue through increased sales and cross-selling opportunities. In this section, you will attempt to implement a recommendation system by identifying similar users' preferences and recommending movies they watch to the study user. 

To be more specific, you will implement your version of the [**LSH algorithm**](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/building-recommendation-engine-locality-sensitive-hashing-lsh-python/), which will take as input the user's preferred genre of movies, find the most similar users to this user, and recommend the most watched movies by those who are more similar to the user. 

__Data__: The data you will be working with can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vodclickstream/netflix-audience-behaviour-uk-movies).

Looking at the data, you can see that there is data available for each user for the movies the user <ins>clicked on</ins>. Gather the __title and genre__ of the __maximum top 10 movies__ that each user clicked on regarding the __number of clicks__.

### 1.2 Minhash Signatures 
Using the movie genre and user_ids, try to implement your min-hash signatures so that users with similar interests in a genre appear in the same bucket. 

__Important note:__ You must write your minhash function from scratch.  You are not permitted to use any already implemented hash functions.  Read the class materials and, if necessary, conduct an internet search.  The description of hash functions in the [book](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch3n.pdf) may be helpful as a reference.

### 1.3 Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

Now that your buckets are ready, it's time to ask a few queries. We will provide you with some user_ids and ask you to recommend at __most fiveÂ movies__ to the user to watch based on the movies clicked by similar users. 

To recommend at most five movies given a user_id, use the following procedure: 

1. Identify the <ins>two most similar</ins> users to this user.
2. If these two users have any movies __in common__, recommend those movies based on the total number of clicks by these users.
3. If there are __no more common__ movies, try to propose the most clicked movies by the __most similar user first__, followed by the other user. 

__Note:__ At the end of the process, we expect to see at most five movies recommended to the user.

__Example:__ assume you've identified user __A__ and __B__ as the most similar users to a single user, and we have the following records on these users: 

- User A with 80% similarity
- User B with 50% similarity
  
|user|movie title|#clicks|
|---|---|---|
|A|Wild Child|20|
|A|Innocence|10|
|A|Coin Heist|2|
|B|Innocence|30|
|B|Coin Heist|15|
|B|Before I Fall|30|
|B|Beyond Skyline|8|
|B|The Amazing Spider-Man|5|

- __Recommended movies__ in order:
    - Innocence
    - Coin Heist
    - Wild Child
    - Before I Fall
    - Beyond Skyline
